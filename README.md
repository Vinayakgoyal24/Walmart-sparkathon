## Project Description

Walmart faces challenges in optimizing the UX of their malls and improving sales performance. This project addresses these challenges by:
- Providing real-time insights into customer behavior through heatmaps generated by computer vision algorithms.
- Offering a centralized product management system for executives to track and optimize product placement.
- Enabling customers to navigate the store more efficiently, improving their overall shopping experience.
- Using machine learning models to analyze factors influencing the conversion of store visits into actual purchases.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

### Backend:
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing machine learning models and handling backend logic.
- **Flask**: (Choose one based on your implementation) For web framework to build the backend RESTful APIs.

### Machine Learning:
- **XGBoost**: For analyzing factors like pricing, discounts, and product placement duration.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: For grouping similar customer behaviors and product interactions.
- **LSTM**: For accounting temporal dependencies in customer behavior analysis.

### Computer Vision:
- **OpenCV**: For real-time traffic monitoring and heatmap generation through camera feeds.
- **YOLO/SSD**: (Optional) For advanced object detection if implemented in the vision system.

### Frontend:
- **Tailwind**
- **React.js**
- **GSAP**
- **ScrollTrigger**

### Data Storage:
- **MongoDB**: (Specify based on your implementation) For storing product details, customer interaction data, and analysis results.

## Features:
- **Heatmap Generation:** Real-time monitoring of customer traffic using strategically placed cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms.
- **Product Management Portal:** A centralized system for Walmart executives to list products with details such as name, price, discount, and stack location.
- **Customer Navigation:** A user-friendly interface for customers to navigate the mall, access product details, and view traffic heatmaps by scanning a QR code.
- **Advanced Analytics Platform:** Tools for Walmart executives to analyze discrepancies between customer visits and purchases using machine learning models like XGBoost, agglomerative clustering, and future integration of LSTM models.

## Usage:
### Walmart Executives:
- Access the portal to manage product listings, view real-time heatmaps, and analyze product performance.
- Use the advanced analytics platform to gain insights into factors affecting sales conversions.
### Customers:
- Scan the QR code at the mall entrance to access the store layout, view traffic heatmaps, and find product details.
